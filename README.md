# Mid_Project
## Hello reader, 

This was my first full project as a Data Analyst. 

The objective was to answer the question:
### Do subsidies have an influence on unemployment in Berlin?

This was a particular interesting project for me because I grew up in Mexico, and unfortunately corruption rarely allows improvements for the country. Then I moved to Berlin and I was amazed about all the subsidies and unemployment programs and grants that exist. Therefore. I was curious how correlated were grants and unemployment rates and determine if there was a direct relation among this. 

The project constisted of 5 stages: 
1. Pre-work
2. Research
3. Cleaning
4. Analysis
5. Presentation

You can check out more about how I organized the project in my Trello: https://bit.ly/trello_mid_project

My findings were intersting, I invite you to take a look at my presentation (feel free to have fun going through the slides!)
And while there are many elements that affect unemployment rates, I was surprised with my findings. 

Finally, I made many visual comparisons before deciding on the best way to present the information, you can check out ALL my graphs here: https://tabsoft.co/3ytIDi0
